## Weather app

### Project based on JavaScript concepts learned from [Maximillian Schwarzmuller's](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) courses. 

Project utilizes API from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/), however, a free sign up is required to obtain own API key in order to fetch data. 

> NOTE: I am removing my API key for security reasons, but it will replace 'your-key'
```
var apiKey = 'your-key';
```
